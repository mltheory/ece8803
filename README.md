### Course Description

In many applications of machine learning (ML), data is collected sequentially; moreover, decisions can impact performance both in the present and the future. This class will deal with the design of ML algorithms for real- time decision making, including reinforcement learning. Classical applications in engineering and modern applications in the ML pipeline will both be discussed, but the focus of the course will be foundational — on understanding design principles and the inner workings of algorithms for online decision-making.

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and explain the basic design principles of any online algorithm under diverse assumptions on the environment and reward feedback mechanism.
- Understand how these principles relate to classical concepts in information theory, signal processing, communications, and control theory.
- Assess the efficacy of an online algorithm for an engineering/machine learning application based on its performance guarantees, tractability of implementation, scalability and assumptions made on the environment.
- Appreciate how online algorithms relate to other aspects of the machine learning pipeline.

**Prerequisites:** undergraduate probability (ECE3077 or equivalent), undergraduate linear algebra (MATH 2551 or equivalent). Mathematical maturity and familiarity with proof-based arguments will be assumed.
